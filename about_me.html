                        I am a 25 year old software engineer with a focus in backend development. I recently decided to transition from a
                        grocery retail background to a career in software engineering. I have always had a passion for technology since I was a child.
                        Trying to create experiences for others to enjoy has always been a goal of mine. I am a self motivated individual who is always striving
                        to create the best possible product. I am always looking for new challenges and ways to improve my skills.
                    </p>

                    <p class="skillsList">
                        The spark that made me want to transition to software engineering was to develop and create applications that can can be used in online tabletop
                        games. I have always had a passion for games and bringing people together. I wanted to create programs that bring my creative writing skills and 
                        immersive storytelling to life. Giving people the ability to play games with friends and family from anywhere in the world as if they are sitting 
                        at the same table.
                    </p>

                    <p class="d-flex text-align-center">
                        Located in the Pacific Northwest, I am a big fan of indie music, video games, animals, and podcasts. I am always looking for new stories to immerse myself in and
                        new music to listen to. With a strong passion for game design and storytelling, I am always looking for new ways to bring people together to create an original experience.
